## Two Question after R1

After R1 was built there were:

Questions that need answering:

1. Do the cubes always stay in the same order?
2. Why does one guy stay outside of the fray?

Paul M responded:

Regarding your two numbered questions:
 
1) If you animate just a line with various starting points you’ll see that they all quickly approach the general vicinity of the attractor (hence the name) but at different entry points. The curve that is drawn looks basically the same but can differ greatly in the details. Since the motion is chaotic it will eventually fill in the entire region, but in the meantime you’ll see random jumps between the two portions of the attractor. That means that your cubes are moving chaotically, and do not stay in the same order.
 
2) The first cube starts at the origin (0,0,0) and according to the equations of motion never acquires any change in position: the change is always proportional to zero.
